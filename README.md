# Drone Simulation and TCP Socket Communication

## Drone Simulation

This Python program simulates the movement of a drone using the Turtle module. The drone can move in four directions: forward, backward, left, and right. The program provides a graphical representation of the drone's movement.

### Instructions

- Run the script `drone_simulation.py`.
- Use the following keyboard bindings to control the drone:
  - **Forward:** Press the 'w' key
  - **Backward:** Press the 's' key
  - **Left:** Press the 'a' key
  - **Right:** Press the 'd' key
- Close the window by clicking on it.

## TCP Socket Communication

This project consists of two Python scripts, `sender.py` and `receiver.py`, that demonstrate simple TCP socket communication.

### Sender (sender.py)

The sender program establishes a TCP connection and sends messages to the receiver.

#### Instructions

- Run the script `sender.py`.
- Enter messages when prompted. Type 'exit' to close the connection.

### Receiver (receiver.py)

The receiver program accepts incoming connections and displays received messages.

#### Instructions

- Run the script `receiver.py`.
- The receiver will wait for a connection.
- After the sender establishes a connection, received messages will be displayed.
- Type 'exit' to close the connection.
